# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository!
Here, I aim to solve at least one problem regularly and share my solutions for practice and learning. 
Contributions, updates, and suggestions for better approaches are highly encouraged via pull requests (PRs).

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChikhalkarS/DatastuctureAndAlgorithm.git  
   cd dsa-practice
   ```

2. Choose a problem or algorithm you'd like to work on from the list of directories.

3. Implement your solution in your preferred programming language.

4. Test your implementation (if applicable) and ensure it solves the problem correctly.

5. Submit your solution by creating a pull request (PR). Include a brief description of your approach and any thoughts or challenges you faced.

## Directory Structure

- **problem1/**: Description of the problem and solution files.
- **problem2/**: Description of the problem and solution files.
- **...**

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can contribute:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-algorithm`).
- Implement your changes or additions.
- Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new algorithm: XYZ'`).
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-algorithm`).
- Create a new Pull Request.

Please ensure your pull request includes a clear description of the problem you're addressing or the improvement you're suggesting.

Happy coding!
